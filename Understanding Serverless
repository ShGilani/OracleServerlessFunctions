Oracle Functions is a FaaS (Functions-as-a-Service platform). It is a fully managed, multi-tenant, highly scalable, on-demand service.
It is built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OCI and powered by the 'Fn Project' - Open Source. Container-native. Serverless platform.

Serverless Architecture - doesn't mean there are no servers involved. It means you donot need to think about servers/infrastructure administration.
You don't provision or maintain compute instances, and operating system software patches and upgrades are applied automatically.

Use cases:
We dont use functions for bulky operations. They are generally lightweight

Write code:
With Oracle Functions, you can write code in Java, Python, Node, Go, and Ruby (5 FDKs available till date)
